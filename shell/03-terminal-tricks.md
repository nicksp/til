# Cursor tips on the command line

While working with the terminal quite often ([iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is my favorite terminal app btw), i find the following tips to be really handy. So will keep them here to bookmark for the future me :)

1. **Tab** — will expand out the matching command or the matching filename. It can be used to finish a command or match an asterisk, like `cat *.css` could expand out to `cat styles.css` or to all space separated css files from the current dir.
1. **Ctrl+D** — will quickly and immediately exit your terminal session.
1. **Ctrl+L** — clears the terminal output and puts the cursor at the top of the screen.
1. **Ctrl+7** — undo for the command line.
1. **Cmd+Alt+B** (Mac only) - using iTerm, will switch into the time travel mode, and you can go back and see all the output from your commands over a fixed period of time.
