# Today I Learned

We constantly learn new things: how to inline SVG into CSS, what is FSL and Layout Trashing and how to prevent that, how to load web fonts without juddering, etc. This is a repo to share those learnings with a community.
TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining
concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned.
