# You can use a button as an input value for a form

That's right :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Turns out there are a bunch of [other cool attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) that a `<button>` can have. You can change the endpoint the form submits to with `formaction` and the request method (GET or POST) with `formmethod`.

Go check 'em!
